refactor component file structure | remove auto-import | remove darkMode form local storage

components are now divided between [storyblok] and [local] folders. Any components generated with v-is are registered globally in the [globalComponents] plugin. All others are imported manually into respective components.

initPreferences mixin may be causing issues when site is statically generated. Removed for now to investigate.
