add <flex-row> component and refactor <media-card>

flex row is intended as a block level layout element into which a variety of components can be inserted.
<media-card> refactor removed slots in order to make the component :content driven like others which rely on CMS data. Portfolio index pages now contain pseudo media cards which use the <media-card> classes and render alternating layouts based on index. Also created <project-preview-copy> and <project-preview-media> components to facilitate alternating layouts if needed.
