refactor <image-asset> for responsive image loading

<image-asset> and <lightbox-modal> now use the <picture> element request resized images at small/med/large breakpoints. A defaultSize can be defined for instances where size constraints don't align with breakpoints.
[storyblokImageService] mixin facilitates.

May look at specifying breakpoints through props in future for more flexibility.
