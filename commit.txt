fix trailing '/' issue with routes

Development/Design indexes were generating incorrect project links after page refresh as a trailing '/' is added to the url. Fixed by defining absolute routes ('/${fullSlug}')
Also fixed an issue in <project-preview-media> component where default image size was looking for an exact route match. Changed this to a startsWith match to account for page refresh
