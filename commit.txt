add <lightbox-modal> component | minor refactor for <development-project>

<lightbox-modal> takes an asset and a [showCaption] boolean. It renders inside <modal-wrapper> with the image as a background.

<development-project> now takes a generic [body] prop and renders contents dynamically. This allows us to make use of <two-column-form> in the same way as <design-project>
