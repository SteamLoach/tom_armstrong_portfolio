format <rich-text> | add [darkMode] and [withJargon] toggles

added copy formatting to <rich-text> component, along with computed classObject based on cms class extensions and any passed thru the classExt prop.

added <dark-mode-toggle> and <jargon-toggle> - both components write to state localStorage. Added a check for existing preferences to layout mount (sets defaults if none found)
