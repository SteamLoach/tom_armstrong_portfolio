init repo with some work done

added logging based on SHOW_LOGS env param
added storyblokBridge mixin which looks for a storyblokBridgeMixin component data object and requests data for the specific page or indexed pages if [isIndex] is true. If [isIndex] mixin assigns page data to [this.story] based on [name === 'Index'] and indexed pages to [this.index]. This'll allow easy generation of previews etc.
